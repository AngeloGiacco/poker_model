# poker_model

The aim of this repo is to create a model that is able to play poker. 

In order to do this there are a few stages that must be done:

1) Creating a poker game 
2) Allowing a computer to play against itself
3) Adding data that is essentially the results of the computer's poker rounds to a database
4) Training a model based on the data in the database. 

Repo started with the help of Ádám (vorpex) whilst doing work experience at Vodafone Hungary's Data Science Team. 

Not currently working on it, pretty much completed stage two. Used OOP to complete stage one.
